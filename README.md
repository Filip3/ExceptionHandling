# ExceptionHandling

A way to manage exceptions. Implementation of a solution for catching and managing custom and general exceptions.

To start the project:
  - Clone project
  - Build solution

Once started, there are a couple of exceptions that are thrown, then caught and managed by the system.
They can be seen in the logs folder under the Web project.
In the base controller you can find the Handle exceptions method, which is used to manage the exceptions.
And in the Core project you can find the custom exception that is being used.
